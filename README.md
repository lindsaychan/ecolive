### Ecolive

Ecolive is the final group project for ECS189H - Huaman Computer Interaction, and centered around creating high-fidelity mockups and prototypes to solve a problem of
the group's choice. My group chose to focus on user sustainability and create a web app that would help encourage people to become more sustainable in their
everyday lives by recommending specific lifestyle changes, as well as providing a profile and way to track a user's progress as they integrate these chanes into
their lives. The goal was to sway users to change their buying habits and therefore convince corporations to change their means of production and manufacturing, as a way to reduce the emissions they output.

We performed user research and tested our prototype with our classmates and peers, concluding with a final presentation infront of our professor.
