### Ecolive

Ecolive is the final project for ECS189H - Huaman Computer Interaction and centered around creating high-fidelity mockups and prototypes to solve a problem of
the group's choice. My group chose to focus on user sustainability and create a web app that would help encourage people to become more sustainable in their 
everyday lives by recommending specific lifestyle changes, as well as providing a profile and way to track a user's progress as they integrate these chanes into 
their lives. The goal was to sway users to change their buying habits and therefore convince corporations to change their means of production, as they produce the most
emissions harming the planet.

We performed user research and tested our prototype with our classmates and peers, and made a final presentation infront of our professor.
